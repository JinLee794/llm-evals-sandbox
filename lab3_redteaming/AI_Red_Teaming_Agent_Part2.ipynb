    "# AI Red Teaming Agent - Part 2: Safety & Security Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Azure AI Foundry's **AI Red Teaming Agent** to proactively assess safety and security risks in your AI agent from Part 1. Building on the Seattle Tourist Assistant agent we created and evaluated, we'll now:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure the AI Red Teaming Agent to scan for safety risks\n",
    "- Run automated adversarial probing against our agent\n",
    "- Evaluate attack success rates across different risk categories\n",
    "- Generate detailed security assessment reports\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI Red Teaming Agent leverages Microsoft's PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Tool) framework integrated with Azure AI Foundry's Risk and Safety Evaluations to systematically probe AI models for vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to spend about 25-30 minutes running this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete Part 1**: Ensure you've completed the `Evaluate_Azure_AI_Agent_Quality.ipynb` notebook\n",
    "2. **Python Version**: Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (PyRIT doesn't support Python 3.9)\n",
    "3. **Azure AI Foundry Project**: Same project from Part 1 with connected storage account\n",
    "4. **Supported Regions**: East US2, Sweden Central, France Central, or Switzerland West\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the red teaming package as an extra from Azure AI Evaluation SDK:\n",

    "In this notebook, we successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Set up the AI Red Teaming Agent** with Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "2. ✅ **Created a target callback function** for our Seattle Tourist Assistant\n",
    "3. ✅ **Ran comprehensive security scans** using multiple attack strategies\n",
    "4. ✅ **Analyzed attack success rates** across different risk categories\n",
    "5. ✅ **Generated security assessment reports** with actionable recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proactive Security**: Red teaming helps identify vulnerabilities before deployment\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Multiple attack strategies provide thorough coverage\n",
    "- **Actionable Insights**: Results include specific recommendations for improvement\n",
    "- **Continuous Process**: Security assessment should be ongoing, not one-time\n",
