    "### Overview\n",
    "A context‑free grammar is a collection of production rules that define which strings belong to a language. Each rule rewrites a non‑terminal symbol into a sequence of terminals (literal tokens) and/or other non‑terminals, independent of surrounding context—hence context‑free. CFGs can capture the syntax of most programming languages and, in OpenAI custom tools, serve as contracts that force the model to emit only strings that the grammar accepts."

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Lark grammars can be tricky to perfect. While simple grammars perform most reliably, complex grammars often require iteration on the grammar definition itself, the prompt, and the tool description to ensure that the model does not go out of distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keep terminals bounded** – use `/[^.\\n]{0,10}*\\./` rather than `/.*\\./`. Limit matches both by content (negated character class) and by length (`{M,N}` quantifier).\n",
    "- **Prefer explicit char‑classes over `.` wildcards.**\n",
    "- **Thread whitespace explicitly**, e.g. using `SP = \" \"`, instead of a global `%ignore`.\n",
    "- **Describe your tool**: tell the model exactly what the CFG accepts and instruct it to reason heavily about compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API rejects the grammar because it is too complex** ➜ Simplify rules and terminals, remove `%ignore.*`.\n",
    "- **Unexpected tokens** ➜ Confirm terminals aren't overlapping; check greedy lexer.\n",
    "- **When the model drifts \"out‑of‑distribution\"** (shows up as the model producing excessively long or repetitive outputs, it is syntactically valid but is semantically wrong):\n",
    "    - Tighten the grammar.\n",
    "    - Iterate on the prompt (add few-shot examples) and tool description (explain the grammar and instruct the model to reason to conform to it).\n",
    "    - Experiment with a higher reasoning effort (e.g, bump from medium to high).\n",

    "Context-Free Grammar (CFG) support in GPT-5 lets you strictly constrain model output to match predefined syntax, ensuring only valid strings are generated. This is especially useful for enforcing programming language rules or custom formats, reducing post-processing and errors. By providing a precise grammar and clear tool description, you can make the model reliably stay within your target output structure."
