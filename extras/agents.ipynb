    "# Multi-Agent Orchestration: Smart City Emergency Response System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced multi-agent orchestration capabilities using Azure AI Agent Service. We'll create a **Smart City Emergency Response System** with three specialized agents that collaborate to handle complex emergency scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🚨 Emergency Dispatcher Agent** - Triages incidents, coordinates response\n",
    "2. **🚑 Resource Allocation Agent** - Manages emergency resources and logistics\n",
    "3. **📢 Communications Agent** - Handles public notifications and stakeholder updates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features Demonstrated:\n",
    "- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has distinct expertise and tool sets\n",
    "- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Agents share context and coordinate actions\n",
    "- **Dynamic Orchestration**: System adapts response based on incident severity\n",
    "- **Tool Specialization**: Each agent has access to domain-specific tools\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional evaluation across all agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Benefits:\n",
    "- Demonstrates real-world multi-agent coordination\n",
    "- Shows how AI agents can handle complex, time-sensitive decisions\n",
    "- Illustrates scalable agent architecture patterns\n",
    "- Provides clear evaluation metrics for each agent type"

      "2. **Issue Ongoing Health Guidance:**\n",
      "   - Continue highlighting: symptoms, where to seek help, and to avoid festival food until further notice.\n",

      "3. **Rumor Management:**\n",
      "   - Address and correct misinformation directly—restate number of confirmed cases and where to get verified information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Positive Reinforcement:**\n",
      "   - Thank public for cooperation, encourage them to stay hydrated, and report symptoms early.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ongoing Monitoring:**\n",
      "   - Maintain frequent updates as confusion/fear could quickly escalate if more cases are reported or if media speculation grows.\n",

    "## Troubleshooting Guide & Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Issue 1: Function Registration in Notebooks**\n",
    "**Problem**: `Function 'assess_incident_severity' not found` errors when running from notebook\n",
    "**Root Cause**: Azure AI Agent Service function registration differs between notebook and portal environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "1. **Use Azure AI Foundry Portal**: Functions work reliably in the web interface\n",
    "2. **Alternative Notebook Approach**: Use simplified agents without complex tool calls\n",
    "3. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all dependencies and authentication are properly configured\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Issue 2: Evaluation Authorization Errors** \n",
    "**Problem**: `AuthorizationFailure` when uploading evaluation datasets\n",
    "**Root Cause**: Insufficient permissions for dataset upload operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**:\n",
    "1. **Check Azure Permissions**: Ensure proper RBAC roles for AI Foundry resources\n",
    "2. **Alternative Evaluation**: Use local evaluation methods or simpler metrics\n",
    "3. **Manual Assessment**: Evaluate agent responses manually using the conversation logs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Working Alternative: Manual Multi-Agent Demonstration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since function registration can be environment-specific, here's a practical approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test individual agent responses manually\n",
    "test_messages = {\n",
    "    'dispatcher': 'Assess emergency: Building fire, 15-story structure, 3 casualties, 200 people inside',\n",
    "    'resource': 'Allocate resources for building fire emergency - high severity incident',\n",
    "    'communications': 'Create public alert for downtown building fire emergency'\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Each agent will respond based on their instructions even without custom functions\n",
    "# This demonstrates the multi-agent coordination concept effectively\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 **Key Multi-Agent Orchestration Benefits Demonstrated**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **✅ Agent Specialization**: Each agent has distinct expertise areas\n",
    "2. **✅ Coordinated Instructions**: Agents designed to work together\n",
    "3. **✅ Scalable Architecture**: Pattern supports complex emergency scenarios  \n",
    "4. **✅ Context Sharing**: Agents can reference other agents' assessments\n",
    "5. **✅ Real-World Application**: Emergency response is perfect multi-agent use case\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Production Recommendations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For production multi-agent systems:\n",
    "1. **Use Azure AI Foundry Portal** for function testing and development\n",
    "2. **Implement proper Azure RBAC** for evaluation and dataset permissions  \n",
    "3. **Consider REST API approach** for more reliable function integration\n",
    "4. **Use Azure Functions** for complex tool implementations\n",
    "5. **Implement proper error handling** and fallback mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎓 **Learning Outcomes Achieved**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with technical constraints, this notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Multi-agent system design principles\n",
    "- Agent specialization and role definition  \n",
    "- Coordination patterns and communication flows\n",
    "- Real-world application architecture\n",
    "- Evaluation methodology and metrics planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concepts of multi-agent orchestration are successfully illustrated, providing a strong foundation for understanding advanced AI agent coordination systems."
